Want to use GPT-5 in Claude Code?

Today you need:
- OpenAI account
- API key management
- $20/mo minimum
- Separate billing

Or... one command:

claude mcp add blockrun npx @blockrun/mcp

No API keys. No accounts. Just works.

Here's how 🧵
```

**Tweet 2 (Problem):**
```
The problem with AI APIs today:

5 providers = 5 accounts + 5 API keys + 5 billing systems

I just want to use the best model for each task without managing all this.
```

**Tweet 3 (Solution):**
```
BlockRun MCP gives you:

✅ 30+ models (GPT-5, Claude, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek)
✅ Zero API keys
✅ One USDC wallet
✅ Pay only for what you use

$5 gets you 1000+ requests.
```

**Tweet 4 (How it works):**
```
How it works:

1. Install: claude mcp add blockrun npx @blockrun/mcp
2. Fund wallet with USDC on Base
3. Use naturally: "ask GPT-5 about quantum computing"

Your wallet signs payments locally. Private key never leaves your machine.
```

**Tweet 5 (Demo/Examples):**
```
Examples:

"blockrun ask GPT-5 to review this code"

"blockrun smart powerful: explain this complex algorithm"

"blockrun generate an image of a cyberpunk city"

"blockrun twitter: what's trending in AI today"
```

**Tweet 6 (Pricing):**
```
Pricing is simple:

- Quick question (Gemini Flash): $0.0001
- Code review (Claude Sonnet): $0.003
- Complex analysis (GPT-5): $0.01
- Image (DALL-E 3): $0.04

No minimums. No subscriptions.
