### r/ClaudeAI (primary)

**Title:**
```
I made an MCP server to use GPT-5, Gemini, and other models in Claude Code without API keys
```

**Body:**
```
I was frustrated managing multiple API keys and accounts just to use different AI models alongside Claude. So I built BlockRun MCP.

**What it does:**
- Access 30+ models (GPT-5, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek) from Claude Code
- No API keys needed - pay per request with crypto
- One command install: `claude mcp add blockrun npx @blockrun/mcp`

**How it works:**
1. Install the MCP server
2. Fund a wallet with USDC on Base ($5 is plenty to start)
3. Use naturally: "blockrun ask GPT-5 about X"

The wallet is auto-generated and your private key stays local (like MetaMask). Payments happen via x402 protocol.

**Example usage:**
- "blockrun smart powerful: analyze this complex algorithm" (auto-picks GPT-5 or Opus)
- "blockrun generate an image of a mountain sunset" (uses DALL-E 3)
- "blockrun twitter: what's trending in AI" (real-time search via Grok)

Would love feedback! What models or features would be most useful?

### r/LocalLLaMA

**Title:**
```
MCP server for using cloud models (GPT-5, Gemini, etc) in Claude Code without API key management
```

**Body:**
```
I know this sub is about local models, but many of us use a mix of local and cloud. Built an MCP server that makes using cloud models frictionless:

- No API keys to manage
- Pay per request with USDC (no monthly minimums)
- 30+ models including GPT-5, Claude Opus, Gemini Pro, Grok

Install: `claude mcp add blockrun npx @blockrun/mcp`

Useful when you need capabilities your local setup doesn't have, like GPT-5's coding or Gemini's 1M context window.

### r/singularity or r/artificial

**Title:**
```
Open source MCP server to access any AI model without managing API keys
```

**Body:**
```
Built BlockRun MCP - an open source Model Context Protocol server that gives you access to 30+ AI models with zero API key management.

Instead of creating accounts with OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, etc. and managing separate billing, you just:

1. Install: `claude mcp add blockrun npx @blockrun/mcp`
2. Fund a crypto wallet with USDC
3. Pay per request (no minimums)

Models available: GPT-5.2, Claude Opus 4, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok 3, DeepSeek V3, and more.

Uses x402 HTTP payment protocol - your wallet signs payments locally, private key never leaves your machine.

## Tips
1. Don't post to multiple subs at once (looks spammy)
2. Start with r/ClaudeAI, wait 1-2 days, then others
3. Respond to all comments
4. Don't be defensive about "why crypto?"
5. Offer to help with setup issues
